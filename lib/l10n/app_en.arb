    "faq_first_question" : "Can I cancel my Appointment?",
    "faq_first_answer" : "If the appointment has more than 72 hours to be done,  you can cancel it for free.",
    "faq_second_question" : "How much time you take to get to my address?",
    "faq_second_answer" : "We try to get there 15 minutes before the appointment starts to prepare all the equipment and get things ready.",
    "faq_third_question" : "I just wash my car and it started to rain, what can I do?",
    "faq_third_answer" : "No problem, if you wash your car with us and within the next 48 hours it started to rain, we are going to provide you the service for free, this is our guarantee",
    "faq_first_details": "Anyone who drives a car knows that it takes effort to keep it spick and span. After all, dirt happens all by itself; clean does not. And while some drivers certainly pay more attention to keeping their vehicles clean than do others, nevertheless, it is easy to neglect having your car washed as often as you should.",
    "faq_second_details": "But washing your car should be a regular occurrence, like replacing your brake pads or changing your oil, only more frequent. So, in an effort to make car washing simpler, here is a list of frequently asked car wash questions.",
    "faq_fourth_question" : "How often should I wash my car?",
    "faq_fourth_answer" : "How often you wash your car could depend on where you live and where you drive. Dirt roads and salted streets might make it necessary to wash your vehicle more frequently than driving on dry ones. In general, you should aim at washing your car once a week - every other week at least - to adequately maintain the body and protect the paint.",
    "faq_fifth_question" : "How should I wash my car?",
    "faq_fifth_answer" : "Professional hand washing is the best bet to keep your car in tip top shape. But that service might not be available or convenient every week. A quality drive-through car wash can be a suitable alternative for those weeks (or locations) where professional hand washing is not feasible. Every so often, you might also consider professional auto detailing for more advanced care.",
    "faq_sixth_question" : "What types of vehicles can go through a car wash?",
    "faq_sixth_answer" : "Most cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs up to 84 inches high and with 4 inches of ground clearance can go through an automatic car wash. Any factory-installed equipment in working order is guaranteed against damage by most car washes.",
    "faq_seventh_question" : "Can I take my pickup truck through the car wash?",
    "faq_seventh_answer" : "Yes. Your pickup truck is fine to go through the car wash if the bed is empty. It is worth noting, however, that some side mirrors are not compatible with some car washes, nor are dual-wheeled vehicles. Some modified trucks, or those with oversized tires, might not work either.",
    "faq_eighth_question" : "Is a car wash safe for a convertible?",
    "faq_eighth_answer" : "Yes. Just not with the top down! Make sure the top is properly latched.",
    "faq_ninth_question" : "What happened to my front license plate?",
    "faq_ninth_answer" : "If your vehicle dons a front license plate, make sure that it is supported by the manufacturer’s license plate frame. In states where front plates are required, manufacturers and dealers are also required to provide you with a license plate frame. Without that support, the spinning equipment in many automatic car washes will damage the plate. If you do not have a frame, simply remove the license plate before going through the car wash.",
    "faq_tenth_question" : "What about other accessories?",
    "faq_tenth_answer" : "Aftermarket accessories, such as bug shields, may go through an automatic wash unharmed. But they are not guaranteed. Damage could occur, especially if the component was previously damaged or compromised by stress cracks around the mounting points or rock chips. A car wash will not damage a trailer hitch, but the hitch could prevent the wash equipment from working as effectively as it should around that area. Any hitch plug left in place could be damaged or come loose in the wash.",
    "faq_eleventh_question" : "Will my antenna get damaged?",
    "faq_eleventh_answer" : "That depends on the type of antenna. Many vehicles today have no external antenna, but some (especially older) models do. When that is the case, a solid flexible antenna is fine for the wash. But hollow, telescoping antennas - whether powered or manual - are not. Make sure those are lowered before entering the car wash.",
    "faq_twelfth_question" : "Will a car wash harm my alloy wheels?",
    "faq_twelfth_answer" : "Your alloy wheels will be just fine in an automatic car wash - as long as the business does not use acids that can stain, or certain tire brushes that can scratch. Ask in advance if you are concerned about your wheels. Generally speaking though, aluminum rims are okay in a car wash.",
    "faq_thirteenth_question" : "Does it matter if my windshield is cracked?",
    "faq_thirteenth_answer" : "It is always best to have a chipped windshield repaired or replaced as soon as possible. But a vehicle with a chipped or cracked windshield can go through an automatic car wash. Understand, however, that while it might be okay to drive through, changes in temperature can cause a chip or crack to expand. Your windshield might not look the same on the way out as when it went in.",
    "faq_fourteenth_question" : "Do eggs and other contaminants come off in the wash?",
    "faq_fourteenth_answer" : "When it comes to certain substances that soil your car, an automatic car wash may or may not clean up the mess. For instance, egg on your vehicle will wash off if you take care of it straight away. But egg quickly becomes corrosive and damage begins almost immediately. If you let egg sit on the surface for any length of time, it will eat into the paint.",
    "faq_fifteenth_question" : "What about bug splatter on the front of your car? ",
    "faq_fifteenth_answer" : "If you catch it quickly, it can be cleaned off in the car wash. There is no guarantee, however, that it will disappear completely. Many automatic car washes offer a special cleaner formulated to address bug splatter (usually at an additional cost), but it needs to be done prior to driving through. Some premium services include pretreatment, and a professional hand washing (or detailing) should include treatment as well.",
